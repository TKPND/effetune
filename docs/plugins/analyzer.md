# Analyzer Plugins

A collection of plugins that let you see your music in fascinating ways. These visual tools help you understand what you're hearing by showing different aspects of the sound, making your listening experience more engaging and interactive.

## Plugin List

- [Level Meter](#level-meter) - Shows digital signal level and possible clipping
- [Note Spectrogram](#note-spectrogram) - Shows estimated pitches over time as a piano roll
- [Oscilloscope](#oscilloscope) - Shows real-time waveform visualization
- [Spectrogram](#spectrogram) - Creates beautiful visual patterns from your music
- [Spectrum Analyzer](#spectrum-analyzer) - Shows the different frequencies in your music
- [Stereo Meter](#stereo-meter) - Visualizes stereo balance and phase relationships

## Level Meter

A visual display that shows your music's digital signal level in real time. It helps you check levels after applying effects and spot possible clipping before it becomes audible distortion.

### Visualization Guide
- The horizontal bar extends farther to the right as the signal level gets louder
- The white marker holds a new peak for one second, then falls smoothly
- OVERLOAD means the signal exceeded the safe digital range and may distort
- For clean playback, avoid frequent red levels or OVERLOAD warnings; set your actual listening volume on your device

## Note Spectrogram

Shows estimated fundamental pitches (F0s) in a selectable range from A0 to C8 in a scrolling piano roll without changing the audio. Use it to follow chord tones, changing vocal and melodic lines, bass lines, and notes that overlap across octaves.

### Visualization Guide

- **Vertical** shows time from left to right, with the keyboard and current sound at the right edge. Higher notes appear toward the top.
- **Horizontal** places the keyboard at the bottom, with low notes on the left and high notes on the right. New sound appears just above the keyboard, and history scrolls upward.
- Lines at each C mark octave boundaries.
- Pitch rows corresponding to black piano keys use a nearly black gray background so they remain distinguishable when no note is detected.
- **Normal** uses the theme’s graph trace color; **Note Colors** uses a different color for each note, repeated across octaves. Both show darker guide lines between E and F.
- **1/12 Octave** shows one row per semitone. **High (1/60 Octave)** divides each semitone into five rows so that small pitch movement is easier to follow; colors are blended between neighboring notes.
- Color follows the model’s confidence from 0 (background color) to 1 (full color), including weak candidates without a display threshold. This score indicates how strongly the model supports a pitch; it is not a calibrated probability.
- With **Volume** on, each detected pitch becomes a bar whose opaque core thickness shows its frequency-corrected relative volume, from 1/60 octave at the bottom of the scale to 1/12 octave at the top. A fade extends 1/120 octave beyond each side of that core, adding 1/60 octave to the total footprint. **Pitch Resolution** changes the bar’s center position, not its core thickness.
- At the keyboard edge, a soft-edged semicircle extends into the graph and shows the current volume. It responds immediately to increases and falls at 20 dB per second; there is no separate visible peak hold.
- The volume scale covers 24 dB. Its top follows the louder of a recent reference used to stabilize the history scale (over about one second) and -36 dB, so quieter material remains readable without making louder passages fill the display continuously. This reference is separate from the current-volume semicircle.
- Octave and E–F guide lines are drawn behind the volume bars so the pitch grid remains a visual reference.
- The keys blend from their normal color toward the display color as confidence in the latest frame increases, reaching that color at 1.
- Changing **Color** recolors the existing history.

### Listening Guide

- Chords appear as several bright rows at the same time
- Melodies and bass lines form paths that move between note rows
- The display estimates pitch; it does not create MIDI or notation, identify instruments, or separate every simultaneous sound completely. Complex overlaps can leave parts of a melody or harmony blank, while percussion, noise, and unclear repeating patterns can produce an occasional incorrect pitch.

### Parameters

- **Color** - Selects the display colors without changing the pitch estimates.
  - **Normal** (default): the theme’s graph trace color.
  - **Note Colors**: a separate color for each note, repeated across octaves.
- **Pitch Resolution** - Selects the vertical pitch detail without clearing the existing history.
  - **1/12 Octave** (default): one row per semitone, using the strongest estimate within that note.
  - **High (1/60 Octave)**: five rows per semitone for finer pitch movement.
- **Layout** - Selects **Horizontal** (default) or **Vertical**. Switching layout preserves the existing history.
- **Volume** - Shows relative volume in bar thickness and semicircle meters. It is on by default; turning it off keeps the original confidence-only rows.
- **Time Span** (1 to 10 s) - Sets how much time the piano roll shows
  - Shorter values make timing changes easier to see
  - Longer values show a longer musical passage at once
  - Default: 2 s
- **Regular Note Limit** (1 to 16 notes) - Sets how many simultaneous notes outside the dedicated low-note range can reach the final detection stage. The default is 8. Increase it for unusually dense chords; lower values reduce analysis work and competition between candidates.
- **Lowest Note** - Sets the bottom of both the displayed and analyzed pitch range. Default: E1.
- **Highest Note** - Sets the top of both the displayed and analyzed pitch range. Default: G6.
- When input is too low for analysis, the piano roll remains dark rather than showing extremely small input as pitches. This suppression does not determine whether a sound would be audible or perceptually masked.

## Oscilloscope

Shows the shape of the sound wave in real time, so you can see beats, sharp hits, and changes in loudness while listening. Trigger settings can steady the display when the waveform repeats.

### Visualization Guide
- Horizontal axis shows time (milliseconds)
- Vertical axis shows normalized amplitude; the visible range changes with Display Level and Vertical Offset
- Green line traces the actual waveform
- Grid lines help measure time and amplitude values
- Trigger settings determine where the waveform capture begins; no separate marker is shown

### Parameters
- **Display Time** - How much time to show (1 to 100 ms)
  - Lower values: See more detail in shorter events
  - Higher values: View longer patterns
- **Trigger Mode**
  - Auto: Continuous updates even without trigger
  - Normal: Freezes display until next trigger
- Trigger detection uses the averaged left/right waveform. Mono input is used directly.
- **Trigger Level** - Amplitude level that starts capture
  - Range: -1 to 1 (normalized amplitude)
- **Trigger Edge**
  - Rising: Trigger when signal goes up
  - Falling: Trigger when signal goes down
- **Holdoff** - Minimum time between triggers (0.1 to 10 ms)
- **Display Level** - Vertical scale in dB (-96 to 0 dB)
- **Vertical Offset** - Shifts waveform up/down (-1 to 1)

### Note on Waveform Display
The waveform connects captured points in time order. For longer display times, each interval retains its first and last samples plus the minimum and maximum samples at their original positions, preserving continuity and short peaks at display resolution. Use it as a visual guide rather than an exact measurement tool.

## Spectrogram

Creates colorful patterns that show how your music changes over time. Colors show how strong each sound is, while vertical position shows its frequency.

The graph scrolls from right to left at a steady speed, with marks every second.

### Visualization Guide
- Colors show how strong different frequencies are:
  - Dark colors: Quiet sounds
  - Bright colors: Loud sounds
  - Watch the patterns change with the music
- Vertical position shows frequency:
  - Bottom: Bass sounds
  - Middle: Main instruments
  - Top: High frequencies

### What You Can See
- Melodies: Flowing lines of color
- Beats: Vertical stripes
- Bass: Bright colors at the bottom
- Harmonies: Multiple parallel lines
- Different instruments create unique patterns

### Parameters
- **DB Range** - How vibrant the colors are (-144dB to -48dB)
  - Lower numbers: See more subtle details
  - Higher numbers: Focus on the main sounds
- **Points** - FFT size used for the display (256 to 16384)
  - Higher numbers: More frequency detail, but slower time updates
  - Lower numbers: Faster movement, but less frequency detail
- **Frequency Scale** - **Log** gives low frequencies more display space; **Linear** places equal frequency widths at equal intervals.
- **Keyboard** - Shows a static keyboard guide at the right of the graph that relates musical notes to frequencies. It does not change the analysis or audio. The keys follow **Log** or **Linear**; with **Linear**, low-frequency keys look narrower.
- The analyzer uses the average of the left and right channels. Mono input is analyzed directly.

## Spectrum Analyzer

Creates a real-time visual display of your music's frequencies, from deep bass to high treble. It's like seeing the individual ingredients that make up the complete sound of your music.

### Visualization Guide
- Left side shows bass frequencies (drums, bass guitar)
- Middle shows main frequencies (vocals, guitars, piano)
- Right side shows high frequencies (cymbals, sparkle, air)
- Higher peaks mean stronger presence of those frequencies
- Darker green line shows the current sound
- The brighter green line follows recent peaks and falls smoothly as they fade
- In **Bar** display, each bar shows the strongest level in an equal-width portion of the display. **Log** uses equal octave widths; **Linear** uses equal frequency widths.
- The thin marker above a bar shows its recent peak and falls smoothly.
- Watch how different instruments create different patterns

### What You Can See
- Bass Drops: Big movements on the left
- Vocal Melodies: Activity in the middle
- Crisp Highs: Sparkles on the right
- Full Mix: How all frequencies work together

### Parameters
- **DB Range** - How sensitive the display is (-144dB to -48dB)
  - Lower numbers: See more subtle details
  - Higher numbers: Focus on the main sounds
- **Points** - How finely the display separates nearby frequencies (256 to 16384)
  - Higher numbers: More frequency detail, with slower updates
  - Lower numbers: Quicker updates, with less frequency detail
- **Frequency Scale** - **Log** gives low frequencies more display space; **Linear** places equal frequency widths at equal intervals.
- **Display** - Changes only how the spectrum looks; it does not change the analysis or audio.
  - **Line** (default): Shows the spectrum as continuous lines.
  - **Bar**: Shows the strongest level in each display band as a bar.
- **Keyboard** - Shows a static keyboard guide below the graph that relates musical notes to frequencies. It does not change the analysis or audio. The keys follow **Log** or **Linear**; with **Linear**, low-frequency keys look narrower.
- The analyzer uses the average of the left and right channels. Mono input is analyzed directly.

## Stereo Meter

A fascinating visualization tool that lets you see how your music creates a sense of space through stereo sound. Watch how different instruments and sounds move between your speakers or headphones, adding an exciting visual dimension to your listening experience.

### Visualization Guide
- **Diamond Display** - The main window where the music comes to life:
  - Center: Very quiet moments or moments where the combined signal is near zero
  - Top/Bottom: Sound shared by left and right channels, such as centered or mono-like content
  - Left/Right: Difference or out-of-phase content between the channels
  - Sounds that are much stronger on one side can appear toward the labeled corners
  - Green dots dance with the current music
  - White line traces the musical peaks
  - The white peak line decays with every audio sample, so its movement stays consistent regardless of the audio processing block size
- **Correlation Bar** (Left side)
  - Shows left/right channel correlation
  - Top (+1.0): Left and right are nearly the same, often sounding centered
  - Middle (0.0): Weak channel relationship, often from wide ambience or unrelated left/right content
  - Bottom (-1.0): Left and right are nearly opposite polarity, which can sound weak on speakers
- **Balance Bar** (Bottom)
  - Shows if one speaker is louder than the other
  - Center: Music equally loud in both speakers
  - Left/Right: Music stronger in one speaker
  - Numbers show how much louder in decibels (dB)

### What You Can See
- **Centered Sound**: Strong vertical movement in the middle
- **Spacious Sound**: Activity spread wide across the display
- **Special Effects**: Interesting patterns in the corners
- **Speaker Balance**: Where the bottom bar points
- **Channel Correlation**: What the left correlation bar shows
