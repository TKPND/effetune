# Compatibility

Python wheels cover CPython 3.10+ on manylinux x86-64, Windows AMD64, macOS Intel, and
macOS Apple Silicon; musllinux is not provided. Node.js `>=18` is required. Chromium
is acceptance-tested. Other evergreen browsers are designed for but unverified.
AudioWorklet support requires HTTPS or localhost; direct `file:` loading is unsupported.
The npm package is ESM-only; use `.mjs` or a consumer package with
`"type": "module"`. CommonJS `require()` is unsupported.

Graph v1 is supported on the JavaScript and Python bindings only; see
[Graph v1 supported surfaces](/dsp/reference/graph-v1/#supported-surfaces).

The core does not decode, encode, resample, call ffmpeg, host VST/AU, or expose public
integrated-LUFS/true-peak measurement.

## Analyzers and telemetry

`LevelMeter`, `NoteSpectrogram`, `Oscilloscope`, `PitchMeter`,
`SpectrumAnalyzer`, `Spectrogram`, and `StereoMeter` expose decoded semantic observations in Python, JavaScript offline and
streaming processing, and AudioWorklet. Telemetry is opt-in: the first callback or
subscriber enables it and the last unsubscribe disables it. Long renders drain after
every processing block. Public frames identify the semantic effect and contain owned
arrays; binary frame types, versions, tap IDs, payload bytes, and Worklet transport stay
private. Unknown or malformed frames are discarded.

Common metadata:

| JavaScript / Python | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` / `kind` | `level`, `noteSpectrogram`, `oscilloscope`, `pitch`, `spectrum`, `spectrumHq`, `spectrogram`, `spectrogramHq`, or `stereo` |
| `effectType` / `effect_type` | Semantic effect type |
| `effectId` / `effect_id` | Declared effect ID, or null / `None` |
| `effectIndex` / `effect_index` | Zero-based position in the declared DSP chain |
| `sequence` / `sequence` | Per-tap telemetry sequence number |
| `dropped` / `dropped` | Frames lost since the previous decoded delivery |

Analyzer fields:

| Kind | JavaScript / Python | Unit and shape / order |
|---|---|---|
| Level | `channels` / `channels` | Processing-channel order; each item has linear-amplitude `peak`, linear-amplitude `rms`, and boolean `clipped` (a sample exceeded full scale) |
| Oscilloscope | `sampleRate` / `sample_rate` | Hz |
| Oscilloscope | `captureSampleCount` / `capture_sample_count` | Samples in the full capture |
| Oscilloscope | `triggerOffset` / `trigger_offset` | Trigger position in samples from capture start |
| Oscilloscope | `triggered` / `triggered` | True for a real trigger; false for an automatic sweep |
| Oscilloscope | `encoding` / `encoding` | `samples` for raw points or `minMax` for ordered envelope points |
| Oscilloscope | `sampleIndices` / `sample_indices` | `[point]` capture indices, paired by position with `values` |
| Oscilloscope | `values` / `values` | `[point]` linear-amplitude values |

| Spectrum | `points` / `points` | FFT size exponent; FFT size is `2 ** points` |
| Spectrum | `binsTruncated` / `bins_truncated` | True when the highest bins were omitted to fit transport capacity |
| Spectrum | `currentDb` / `current_db` | dBFS `[bin]`, ascending frequency from DC |

| Spectrum HQ / Spectrogram HQ | `hop` / `hop` | Nominal analysis step in input samples |
| Spectrum HQ / Spectrogram HQ | `generation`, `frameIndex` / `generation`, `frame_index` | Non-zero analysis generation and unsigned observation counter within it |
| Spectrum HQ / Spectrogram HQ | `captureEnd` / `capture_end` | End sample index of the aligned analysis capture; JavaScript uses `bigint` |
| Spectrum HQ / Spectrogram HQ | `cellCount`, `minFrequency`, `maxFrequency` / `cell_count`, `min_frequency`, `max_frequency` | Log-frequency grid count and bounds in Hz |
| Spectrum HQ / Spectrogram HQ | `firstValidIndex`, `validCellCount` / `first_valid_index`, `valid_cell_count` | Contiguous valid part of the grid; cells outside it have no input-band data |
| Spectrum HQ | `currentDb` / `current_db` | dBFS `[cell]`, in ascending log-frequency grid order |

| Note Spectrogram | `frameIndex` / `frame_index` | Unsigned observation counter within the current analysis generation |
| Note Spectrogram | `divisionsPerSemitone` / `divisions_per_semitone` | `5`; each semitone has bins at -40, -20, 0, +20, and +40 cents around its center |
| Note Spectrogram | `generation` / `generation` | Non-zero analysis generation; a change indicates that analyzer state restarted |
| Note Spectrogram | `levels` / `levels` | Pitch confidence in [0, 1] as JavaScript `Float32Array[440]` or Python `tuple[440]`; index `i` maps to MIDI `firstMidi + (i - 2) / divisionsPerSemitone` |
| Note Spectrogram | `volumeDb` / `volume_db` | Volume in dB as JavaScript `Float32Array[440]` or Python `tuple[440]`, with the same pitch indexing as `levels`; values include a 3 dB/octave correction above 100 Hz, and -240 dB means no level was measured |

| Stereo | `discontinuity` / `discontinuity` | True when the sample delta is incomplete after truncation or a window change |
| Stereo | `samples` / `samples` | JavaScript `Float32Array[side0, mid0, ...]`; Python `tuple[(side, mid), ...]`; linear amplitude where side is R-L and mid is L+R |

`frame.dropped` reports loss since the previous decoded delivery. By contrast,
`dropped_telemetry_frames` on a Python stream and `droppedTelemetryFrames` on a
JavaScript stream or node are cumulative for that object's lifetime.

Telemetry stays local: the library only passes decoded frames to in-process Python
callbacks or callbacks in the browser page. It does not automatically collect, persist,
or send telemetry over the network, and it does not collect device or user identifiers.

Other catalog telemetry remains metadata-only. Integrated LUFS, BS.1770/EBU
R128, true peak, and dynamics gain-reduction observations are not part of this API.
