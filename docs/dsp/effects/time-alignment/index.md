## Time Alignment

Adjusts playback timing by a small amount, useful when you want to compensate for speaker distance differences or tune how the sound arrives at your listening position.

### When to Use
- Compensating for small distance differences between speakers and your listening position
- Fine-tuning the timing of channels routed through this plugin
- Checking whether a small delay makes the stereo image feel more stable or natural

### Parameters
- **Delay** - Controls the delay time applied to the channels routed through this plugin (0 to 500 ms)
  - 0 ms: No delay
  - Small values: Useful for compensating tiny arrival-time differences between speakers
  - Higher values: Creates a more noticeable timing shift

### Recommended Uses

1. Speaker Distance Compensation
   - Add a small delay when one speaker or channel arrives earlier at the listening position
   - Adjust in small steps while listening to centered vocals or other focused sounds

2. Listening Position Fine-Tuning
   - Try very small values first
   - Stop when the center image feels stable and the sound remains natural

Remember: The goal is to enhance your listening enjoyment. Experiment with the controls to find sounds that add interest and depth to your favorite music without overpowering it.
