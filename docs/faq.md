## 1. Initial Setup for Streaming

Windows example: Spotify → VB-CABLE → EffeTune → DAC/AMP. Concepts are similar for other services and OSes.

### 1.1. Installing VB-CABLE and the optional 96 kHz aliasing fix

Download the VB-CABLE Driver Pack45, run `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` as administrator, and reboot. Installation may change the OS default output to **CABLE Input**; if so, change it back to your speakers or DAC.

If using VB-CABLE produces aliasing noise above 20 kHz, its internal 48 kHz rate is the cause. For this specific problem, set both **CABLE Input** and **CABLE Output** formats to 24-bit, 96,000 Hz. Then launch `VBCABLE_ControlPanel.exe` as administrator, choose **Menu▸Internal Sample Rate = 96000 Hz**, and click **Restart Audio Engine**. Administrator access is required for this setting to remain after reboot. This changes VB-CABLE itself and is not required for normal use of EffeTune at 96 kHz.

### 1.2. Streaming service routing (Spotify example)
Open **Settings▸System▸Sound▸Volume mixer**, and set `Spotify.exe` output to **CABLE Input**. Play a track to confirm silence from the speakers.
On macOS, use Rogue Amoeba's **SoundSource** to assign Spotify output to **CABLE Input** in the same manner.

### 1.3. EffeTune audio settings
Open EffeTune and choose **Audio Configuration** from the Settings menu.
- **Input Device:** CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)
- **Output Device:** Physical DAC/Speakers
- **Sample Rate:** Select 96 kHz. This is EffeTune's internal processing rate and normally does not require changing the OS, audio-device, or VB-CABLE rates. It reduces audible-band aliasing from nonlinear effects whose anti-aliasing is limited. Confirm the effective Sample Rate shown in the app. If playback drops out, first reduce demanding effects or the number of active effects, then lower the rate if needed. This setting is separate from the VB-CABLE-specific fix above.

### 1.4. Operation check
With Spotify playing, toggle the master **ON/OFF** in EffeTune and confirm the sound changes.

## 2. Troubleshooting

### 2.1. Audio playback quality issues

| Symptom | Solution |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropouts or glitches | Choose **Reset Audio** from the Settings menu or mobile overflow menu. In the desktop app, you can also choose **Reload** from the **View** menu. Reduce the number of active effects if necessary. |
| Distortion or clipping | Insert **Level Meter** at the end of the chain and keep levels below 0 dBFS. Add **Brickwall Limiter** before Level Meter if needed. |
| Aliasing above 20 kHz when using VB-CABLE | Its internal rate may still be 48 kHz. Follow the optional 96 kHz procedure in section 1.1. |

### 2.2. High CPU usage
Disable effects you're not using or remove them from the **Effect Pipeline**.

### 2.3. Echo
Your input and output devices may be looping back. Ensure EffeTune's output does not return to its input.

### 2.4. Input, output, or effect problems

| Symptom | Solution |
| ------ | ------ |
| No audio input | Make sure the player outputs to **CABLE Input**. Allow microphone permission in the browser and select **CABLE Output** in **Audio Configuration**. |
| Effect not working | Confirm the master, each effect, and any **Section** are **ON**. Reset parameters if needed. |
| No audio output | Check **Audio Configuration**. If your browser cannot select an output device, check that the OS and browser default output point to your DAC/AMP. |
| Other players report "CABLE Input in use" | Ensure no other application is using **CABLE Input**. |

### 2.5. Multichannel output mismatch
EffeTune outputs channels in numeric order, up to 16 channels. Match **Output Channels** to the layout configured for your device. For a 7.1ch setup, set both the device and EffeTune to 8ch and use the device's channel labels when routing rear audio. For a 16-channel setup, select 16 channels in both places and confirm the device's channel mapping.

## 3. Multichannel & Hardware Connections

### 3.1. HDMI + AV receiver
Set your PC's HDMI output to match the receiver's speaker layout and connect it to an AV receiver. EffeTune can send up to 16 channels through a single cable when the PC, receiver, and HDMI connection support them. Older receivers may degrade sound quality or remap channels unexpectedly.

### 3.2. Interfaces without multichannel drivers (e.g., MOTU M4)
Out 1‑2 and Out 3‑4 appear as separate devices, preventing 4‑channel output. Workarounds:
- Use **Voicemeeter** to merge channels via ASIO.
- Use **ASIO Link Pro** to expose one virtual 4‑channel device (advanced).

### 3.3. Channel delay & time alignment
Use **MultiChannel Panel** or **Time Alignment** to delay channels in 10 µs steps (minimum 1 sample). When matching front speakers to Bluetooth or wireless rear speakers with much greater measured latency, delay the front channels by 100‑400 ms; this is not a typical value for speaker-distance correction. Video sync must be adjusted on the player side.

### 3.4. 16ch limit and expansion
EffeTune currently supports up to 16 output channels.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions

| Question | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Which devices can use the PWA version? | EffeTune works on major mobile and desktop environments, including Android phones and tablets, iPhone/iPad, Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS. Because the PWA runs in the browser rather than as a device-specific native app, installation steps, audio input/output device selection, and supported music file formats depend on the browser and OS. |
| I can't install the PWA version | Use the **Install PWA version** button on the EffeTune site, or open the gear menu in the upper-right of the web app and choose **Install App**. If the install option does not appear, open the site in Chrome or Edge on Android or desktop. On iPhone/iPad, open it in Safari and add it to the Home Screen from the Share menu. In-app browsers, private browsing, and older browsers may not show an install option. |
| Surround input (5.1ch etc.)? | The Web Audio API limits input to 2 channels. Output and effects support up to 16 channels. |
| Recommended effect chain length? | Use as many effects as your CPU allows without causing dropouts or high latency. |
| How to get the best sound quality? | Set EffeTune's **Sample Rate** to 96 kHz, start with subtle effect settings, and monitor headroom with **Level Meter**. If playback drops out, first reduce demanding effects or the number of active effects, then lower the sample rate if needed. Add **Brickwall Limiter** if needed. |
| Does it work with any source? | Yes. With a virtual audio device you can process streaming, local files, or physical equipment. |
| Can EffeTune play DRM-protected content? | Not directly. EffeTune processes audio, while protected content is designed to play only in environments authorized by its provider and may not be available to third-party audio processing apps. Use the provider's official app or website, following its terms and supported audio-output methods. EffeTune does not remove or bypass content protection. |
| Can I use only the music file player without an audio input? | Yes. If microphone audio bleeds into your headphones or earphones after startup, open **Audio Configuration** and set **Input Device:** to **None (music file player only)**. EffeTune uses a silent source so the effect pipeline remains active for the player and signal-generating effects such as **Oscillator**. If you select an audio input instead, you can process sound from external equipment through a USB audio interface or monitor the input with **Spectrum Analyzer**. |
| Can the mobile web app process audio from other apps? | Usually no. Mobile browsers do not provide a general loopback input from other apps, so mobile use is centered on EffeTune's music player. |
| Which music file formats are supported? | Support depends on the browser and OS audio decoder. As a practical baseline, MP3, WAV, and AAC/M4A work in many environments, while FLAC, OGG/Vorbis, and Opus/WebM vary by environment. EffeTune can also play the audio track in an MP4 file without displaying video; MP4 playback depends on its internal audio codec, with AAC being the most common compatible choice. If a file does not play, try MP3, AAC/M4A, or WAV. |
| Can I play multiple music files? | Yes. Use **Open music files** and select multiple files in the device's standard file picker before opening them; EffeTune loads them as a playlist. Multiple selection and selecting all files in a folder depend on the device, browser, and file picker. |
| What does Music Library do? | It indexes selected music folders so you can browse and search by track, album, artist, genre, or direct parent subfolder, then play results through EffeTune. It stores library metadata and playlists in the app, not in the audio files. |
| Where is Music Library available? | The desktop app has the full folder scanner. Chromium browsers use File System Access when available. Safari and Firefox use an import fallback, so folder or file access may need to be selected again after reload or permission loss. |
| How do I refresh or reconnect Music Library folders? | Use **Rescan Music Library** after adding, removing, or editing files. If a folder reports missing access, use its **Reconnect** button and grant access to the same folder again. |
| Which playlist formats can Music Library import or export? | Music Library can import M3U, M3U8, PLS, and XSPF playlists, and can export M3U8 or XSPF playlists. |
| Does Music Library change my audio files? | No. Scanning, metadata reading, artwork caching, playlist editing, and playback actions stay inside the app and never modify audio files on disk. |
| Why is output device selection unavailable in the web app? | Browser support and permissions vary. Use Chrome/Chromium on a secure page, or set the desired DAC/AMP as the OS/browser default output. |
| Why did Sample Rate or Output Channels fall back to another value? | The settings screen shows 96 kHz as the Sample Rate default, but before you save a setting the app may start at the OS or browser default. In the Web version, the browser or device may reject 96 kHz or another unsupported value, so EffeTune uses an available rate instead. Check the effective Sample Rate shown in the app. Output-channel support also depends on the browser and device. |
| Why did the sample-rate and channel indicator turn red? | EffeTune detected that enabled effect processing could not finish in real time. The red warning disappears about 10 seconds after processing recovers. Reduce the number of enabled effects. |
| Does the web player remember my playlist? | Repeat/shuffle settings are saved, but the selected music files are not restored after reload because browsers do not keep normal file selections. |
| Does mobile playback continue when the screen turns off? | Not reliably on all browsers, especially iOS. EffeTune uses Wake Lock where available, but background playback is browser-dependent. |
| How do EffeTune's power-saving modes differ? | They are available in the Web/PWA and Electron desktop apps. Open **Config** → **Power saving**. **Background processing priority** keeps external-input processing active during silence. **Balanced power saving (Default)** reduces DSP and visual updates during silence while normally retaining the selected audio input. **Maximum power saving** can also stop an unused or background-silent input after the selected delay. Playback can remain active while DSP is bypassed or held at zero when the current routing proves that this is safe. There is no separate state indicator; **Resume audio processing** or **Resume audio input** appears in the menu only when user action is required. |
| What does Skip display-only DSP when hidden do? | It is on by default. When graphs cannot be shown, EffeTune bypasses Analyzer effects to reduce processing load. This includes when the Effect Pipeline is not displayed—for example, in the Music Library, on the mobile Player tab, or during a Double Blind Test—as well as when EffeTune is minimized or in Mini Player, or when its browser page is hidden. Audio passes through the bypassed effects unchanged, and analysis resumes when graphs can be shown. Turn it off if analysis must continue in the background. |
| What does Sync Visuals to Audio do? | It aligns graphs and meters with the sound you hear. It is off by default because it can add audio delay. It is not available in the browser extension, and Bluetooth or similar devices may still leave the visuals slightly out of sync. |
| What do Silence threshold and Stop audio input after change? | **Silence threshold** (-90 to -20 dBFS in 10 dB steps) controls the measured input/output power below which EffeTune treats audio as silent; a lower value is less likely to classify quiet audio as silence. In **Maximum power saving**, **Stop audio input after** (1/5/15 minutes or **Never**) controls only microphone/input release. It is independent of the shorter delay used to suspend an idle no-route audio graph, so the graph may suspend while the input is still retained. |
| Will Background processing priority guarantee processing while the Web/PWA app is hidden? | No. It asks EffeTune to prefer continued processing and avoids EffeTune's automatic silence suspension for an external-input route, but the browser and OS may still freeze, suspend, or discard a hidden page. If **Maximum power saving** stopped the input, returning to the page or receiving a signal does not silently request microphone permission again; use **Resume audio processing** from an explicit user action. |
| AV receiver vs. interface cost? | Reusing an AV receiver with HDMI is simple. For PC-centric setups, a multichannel interface plus small amps offers good cost and quality. |
| No sound from other apps right after installing VB-CABLE | The OS default output was switched to **CABLE Input**. Change it back in sound settings. |
| Only channels 3+4 change volume after splitting | Place a **Volume** effect after the splitter and set **Channel** to 3+4. If placed before, all channels change. |
| Why does shared IR Reverb sound dry or report a missing IR? | URLs and presets store only the IR content ID, not the audio file. Import the exact original file to relink automatically, or choose a substitute in **Impulse Response Library**. Also check **Dry** and **Dry Level**: with a missing IR, no wet signal is produced. |
| How can another person reproduce my IR Reverb result? | Share the preset or URL together with the original IR file and its source/license information. The recipient should import the unchanged file; identical bytes produce the same ID. Also match audio sample rate, output-channel selection, and IR Reverb settings. |

## 5. Frequency Response & Room Correction

### 5.1. Importing AutoEQ settings into 15Band PEQ
Import AutoEQ equalizer settings directly from the button in the top right.

### 5.2. Pasting measurement correction settings
Copy the 5Band PEQ settings from the measurement page and paste into the **Effect Pipeline** view using **Ctrl+V** or the menu.

### 5.3. Using a multichannel measurement with Room EQ
On the measurement page, select the individual channels you want under **Output Channel** to measure them in one session. After saving, Room EQ lists a separate entry for each channel, such as `Measurement name [Ch 1]`, in **Measurement Ch 1**, **Measurement Ch 2**, and the other channel-specific lists. In each **Measurement Ch** list, select the entry that matches that output channel. Room EQ does not assign channels automatically.

Use **Copy Channel PEQ Settings** when you want to paste a static frequency-response correction into the **Effect Pipeline**. Use Room EQ when you want impulse-response-based room correction for each channel.

## 6. Effect Operation Tips
* Signal flow is top to bottom.
* Use the **Matrix** effect for conversions like 2→4ch or 16→2ch (set **Channel = All** in bus routing).
* Manage level, mute, and delay for up to 16 channels with **MultiChannel Panel**.
* For a multichannel reverb send/return, use **Matrix** to copy the desired source channels to a spare bus, place **IR Reverb** on that bus with **Dry** off and **Wet Level** at 0 dB, then use Matrix gains as send levels. Route the wet bus back only to the intended output channels so the original dry path is not duplicated.
