// output stages of this plugin fail in different ways, so the thresholds belong
// to the stage rather than to the detector.
//
// The line stage diverges. Its loop has no clipping element that limits the
// travelling wave, so once it goes unstable the wet output and the plate tap run
// away past full scale within tens of milliseconds. A level floor above full
// scale, compared window against window at the 10 ms window, identifies that and
// nothing else.
//
// The power stage does not diverge. Its valves clip, so an unstable loop settles
// into a limit cycle at 0.2 to 0.5 of the 25 V output reference with the
// secondary feedback tap at 1.1 to 7.4 per cent of the output. Three facts,
// measured on the three canonical power circuits at 44.1/48/96/192 kHz with
// 0.9 FS noise for one second followed by silence, fix what the power stage
// needs (10 ms detector windows, output normalised by the 25 V reference):
//
//   quiescent residual, no instability   output <= 9.2e-7   tap <= 3.6e-8
//   established limit cycle              output >= 2.0e-1   tap >= 4.7e-3
//   low-frequency thump after the burst  output <= 6.9e-1   tap <= 2.7e-2
//
// The first two lines are why the line stage's floors are unreachable here and
// why a floor placed on the power stage's own scale has two decades of margin on
// either side. The third line is why a floor alone cannot decide: the thump that
// every one of these circuits produces when a loud passage stops is louder than
// the weakest limit cycle. What separates them is time. The thump is the tail of
// a stable circuit and rings down as a clean exponential - 12.3 dB/s at the
// slowest setting measured that is still stable - while a limit cycle rings down
// at nothing. The existing non-decay ratio cannot see that at the 10 ms window,
// because 1.15 over 10 ms is a decay rate of 121 dB/s and every ring-down reads
// as "not decaying" against it. So the power stage evaluates the same predicates
// over a coarse window accumulated from 25 of the 10 ms windows: over 250 ms the
// slowest stable ring-down loses 3.1 dB where the ratio asks for 1.22 dB, and a
// limit cycle loses nothing. Three consecutive coarse windows latch, so a power
// stage that is oscillating is muted one second after the input goes silent.
//
// The post-input branch also has to decide that the input is no longer what is
// driving the loop, and comparing the input against zero only decides that on a
// file. A live input never reaches bit-exact zero: an ADC noise floor sits at
// -90 to -110 dBFS, 24-bit dither at 2^-23, an upstream effect leaves a tail,
// and one non-zero sample was enough to hold the branch shut for good. A level
// floor on the input cannot stand in for it either - a canonical circuit fed a
// steady 2.0e-6 puts 2.79e-4 through the output floor, so an input floor loose
// enough to cover dither false-latches a shipped preset.
//
// What narrows the two states down is the loop's own return ratio. The
// secondary tap is the signal the loop subtracts from the input, so while the
// input is driving a stable loop the tap is the input times T/(1+T) and cannot
// much exceed it. Over 1026 takes of the shipped power presets - six sample
// rates, five stopping signals, five residual floors, and steady sine, noise and
// programme material from -120 dBFS to full scale - the coarse tap stayed at or
// below 0.383 of the coarse input for as long as the input was actually driving
// the stage, and the largest driven ratio measured anywhere is 0.713. That bound
// holds over the driven interval only. Once the input decays to a residual the
// numerator is the circuit's own tail and the denominator is whatever is left of
// the input, so the ratio diverges as the residual falls, on stable presets as
// much as on oscillating ones: coarse window 3 of the shipped
// power-el34-distributed-20-37w preset at its canonical nf = 4 reads 43.8, more
// than fourteen times the gate, and the three canonical power circuits - all of
// them stable - read 1.17e4 to 2.09e4 against a 1e-9 residual and 98 to 175
// against a 24-bit dither floor, against the 262 to 291 an oscillating stage
// reads on a -90 dBFS ADC floor. Below roughly -60 dBFS of residual the ratio
// does not separate the two states at all and the gate is simply true.
//
// What separates them there is the coarse non-decay test, on its own. Against
// the 1.2140 dB it asks for over 250 ms, the worst coarse window of a shipped
// power preset loses 12.43 to 14.05 dB - 10.2 to 11.6 times the requirement -
// and 5.57 dB at nf = 10, still 4.6 times. Shorten the coarse window span or
// loosen the non-decay ratio and shipped presets false-latch immediately. The
// gate cannot stand in for it.
//
// The gate value has a band of its own, measured at [0.72, 8.30]. Below the
// largest driven ratio, 0.713, driven windows start passing it. Above 8.30 the
// capture of power-el84-pentode-10w at nf = 16 with a -60 dBFS residual is lost:
// its three qualifying coarse windows read 8.30 / 9.14 / 9.27, so gates 3 and 8
// latch and leave a -64.77 dBFS tail while gates 12 and 16 do not latch and
// leave the limit cycle audible at -7.31 dBFS. Three sits near the logarithmic
// centre of that band, 4.2 times above the lower edge and 2.77 times below the
// upper. A drive ratio of zero selects the bit-exact-zero test instead, which is
// what the line stage keeps.
//
// The growth branch had the same blind spot in its own form. It compared the
// output and the tap against their own previous windows and never looked at the
// input, so anything that made the input grow by fifteen per cent per 10 ms
// window for three windows satisfied it, and that is an ordinary swell. Measured
// on the shipped line presets at every sample rate, a 1 kHz tone rising from
// silence to 0.3 FS or more over 50 ms to 500 ms latched the fault and left the
// plugin in permanent dry bypass, as did tremolo'd programme material at any
// attack time at all - 646 of 2652 takes. The predicates now ask whether the
// loop is growing faster than it is being driven, which is what running away
// means and what the branch was always meant to say: the window ratio has to
// beat the input's own window ratio by the same factor. A swell moves both
// together, so the ratio of ratios sits at 1.00 against a threshold of 1.15,
// while a loop that has come off its leash owes nothing to the input. It is
// written as a product so that a silent window, where both inputs are zero,
// keeps the plain ratio test the line stage was calibrated on.
